      <h2>Hey, I'm Jonathan</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a software developer living in Toronto, Ontario. My work is mostly
        focused on building React frontends and Node APIs, but I also have a
        keen interest in functional programming, WebGL, and machine learning.
        I'm a polyglot; I enjoy learning new programming languages and playing
        around with all sorts of different patterns, frameworks, and libraries.
        I'm learning Clojure at the moment, and I'm absolutely enamored of it.

      <h2>My story</h2>
      <p>
        I discovered my love for tinkering with tech when I was about 10 years
        old; I really enjoyed building computers, messing around with Linux, and
        taking apart electronics to see how they worked. Eager to experience
        life, I spent most of my early 20s writing, traveling, and doing
        volunteer work on organic farms. In 2014, I taught myself Ruby, and
        immediately realized that I had found my calling. Since then, I have
        been professionally involved in a number of exciting projects and
        codebases. I am extremely passionate about what I do, and I love working
        on challenging problems that allow me to hone my craft and think in new
        ways.
